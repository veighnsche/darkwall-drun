The integrated terminal that has been given to you DOES NOT have graphics support... if you need to test graphics support tell the user to test it in a kitte terminal environment installed on their NixOS system

You cannot just test the drun just by running drun without timeout... you will hang yourself in the interactive terminal and you cannot get out unless the user intervenes.
